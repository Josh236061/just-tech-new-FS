Rice Bootcamp Module Assignemt 14: Just Tech News, Full Stack

## Introduction

You'll finish your first completely full-stack application! You’ve already built 
the back end for Just Tech News, a tech news website where users can post, upvote, 
and comment on links to news articles. Now you’ll create the front end using 
Handlebars.js, a popular templating engine. Your application’s codebase will also 
be structured to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, to ensure a 
separation of concerns. Finally, to provide authentication, you’ll build on the 
password hashing from the application’s back end so that logged-in users can update 
and delete their posts through a special dashboard interface.

## User Story

Render dynamic HTML using the Handlebars.js template engine.

Explain and implement MVC modularization in a full-stack web application.

Configure Heroku for deployment of an application using MySQL.

Explain the interaction between the Model, View, and Controller.

Explain separation of concerns and its benefits.

Implement user authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria

Structure your application following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm.

Modularize your code into separate folders for your Models, View, and Controllers 
to enforce separation of concerns.

Render dynamic HTML for your views using the Handlebars.js template engine.

Implement user authentication.

Configure Heroku so that you can deploy your application using a MySQL database.
